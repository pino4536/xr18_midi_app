The wifi router function for the XR18 is so disappointed. We need to connect XR18 with another router to use it, even if we just want to perform a simple sound check.
Why not using MIDI to control basic operations over XR18? I was thinking of working on this project long time ago but my programming in javascript was so weak.
Thanks to the latest AI tech we now have a working MIDI control UI for XR18 digital mixer. Although limited MIDI implementation is available, basic unmute functionality could save our lifes during stage performance! give it a try and use this app as your best backup plan! (in case of wifi disconnection)
